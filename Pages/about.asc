C4 is a creative-coding framework for iOS that lets you quickly build rich, interactive and expressive applications.

Media
-----
C4 makes working with media very easy.

Purpose
-------
One of the major goals of C4 is to simplify the process of creating expressive mobile applications. It does so by providing a simple way of building and running native iOS applications. 

A second goal of the project is to take advantage of the hardware and software systems available on mobile devices. In C4 things like multitouch, hardware sensors, connectivity between devices and access to social media networks is as easy as working with movies, images and so on...

Language
--------
C4 is positioned to give you the opportunity to learn to program native applications.

Learn
~~~~~
If you're really interested in building native apps, and don't have much experience in the field, you can start with C4 and tear it apart. The entire framework is built on top of core iOS technologies, the API is designed to be similar to Objective-C, and because it's open-source you can download and dig into the backend code to see how things actually work.

Take Advantage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Developers can also take advantage of C4 by embedding it in their projects. The framework is available as a compiled library, and as raw header and implementation files. There are a lot of tricks and techniques that people could possibly use on their own. In particular, C4 is largely designed to take advantage of Core Animation and AVFoundation, so if there are things you want to learn, or copy, by all means just *dig in*.

Open Source
-----------
C4 is an open source project, hosted on GitHub.

It has an link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License#License_terms[MIT license], so it's as open as possible.

Enjoy!

Environment
-----------
Because the project is designed for developing _native_ mobile applications, the development environment you'll need to use is link:https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode]. You'll be able to create apps for the simulator, as well as for iPad, iPhone and iPod devices (if you have a developer account).
