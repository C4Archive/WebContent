These are notes for the second session of _C4: Media & Interactivity_ workshop at link:http://www.viviomediaarts.com[VIVO] starting May 6th, 2013.

Media Mashup
------------
This session is going to build a little bit on last session and then branch off into working with all other kinds of media in C4. The building will create a perspective image of the inside of a cube and then line each plane with an image of the C4 logo.

After we run through that I would like to go through one or two of the tutorials on media that are up but not yet published. The reason being is that there's tons of great content there and its all new... And, we can learn a lot from it.

Perspective Logo
----------------
To create a perspective logo we're going to first create an image.
