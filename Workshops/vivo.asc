Thanks for joining the newest workshop on C4 at link:http://www.vivomediaarts.com[VIVO]! I'm pretty excited to be hosting this workshop because it's the first one in Vancouver, and the first one at VIVO too.

Intro
-----
I've designed this workshop to be a solid foundation for getting started with C4 as an API for building creative and expressive applications. There is really _too much_ to teach in a single session or a single workshop but, because of its design, there are fundamentals common to almost everything in C4 that are important to understand right at the very beginning. 

This workshop is meant to teach just that. 

In doing so, I've split up the workshop into 4 main sections. 3 of these tackle an important concept and highlight examples of code that will get you rolling along. The fourth session will be for open questions and the chance to work on anything that might interest you.

Gestalt
-------
The first session will focus on working with shapes to create gestalt imagery. The shapes and images we'll be creating will be fairly simple, but they'll also be designed in a way that highlights some of the important characteristics of working with objects in C4.

Media Mashup
------------
In this session participants will be challenged to integrate images, audio and video into the gestalt works they created and build upon what they learned in the previous session. At the end of the session participants will be asked to think about a directed project they want to create.

Directed Projects
-----------------
In this session participants will continue working on their directed projects. New concepts and specific techniques that arise through their experimentation will be discussed.

Participants will also be introduced to some pretty fresh new content for the C4 site. We just finished working on *125* new examples and *20* new tutorials.
