The easiest way to create an image is to specify its file name (after you've dragged it into your Xcode project).

image::imageNamed/imageNamed.png["Image Named",height=500]

Create An Image
---------------
When an image is in your Xcode project you can create a C4Image by passing its entire filename.

[source]
----
C4Image *img = [C4Image imageNamed:@"C4Sky.png"];
----

.C4Sky/C4Table?
[NOTE]
When you create a new C4 project in Xcode, two images are included. These images are named C4Sky.png and C4Table.png, and can be used throughout examples and other projects. They can also be deleted from your project and others used, if you first drag them into the files panel on the left side of the Xcode window.
