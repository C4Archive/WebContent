The line dash phase is a value that tells the pattern *where to start* along the length of the line.

Setting the Phase
-----------------
The value of the _lineDashPhase_ property is measured from 0 to 1 with 0.5 being halfway towards the end of the line.

----
shape.lineDashPhase = ...;

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to notice the effects of setting the _lineDashPhase_ you need to first have set the _lineDashPattern_ for a shape.

To start a pattern halfway through a shape's line you can do the following:

[source]
----
CGFloat pattern[2] = ...;
[shape setLineDashPattern:pattern pointCount:2];
shape.lineDashPhase = 0.5f;
----

.What about everything before 0.5?
[NOTE]
Because the pattern repeats itself, if you set the phase halfway along the line the pattern will draw to the end of the line and the continue from the front until it gets back to where it started.
