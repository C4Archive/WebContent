To change the size of a font object, you create a copy of it with a bigger size and assign it to your original object. This is similar to the technique used for link:colorWithAlpha.php[changing a color's alpha].

Font With Size
--------------
To create a copy of a font with a larger size, do the following:

[source]
----
C4Font *initial = [C4Font fontWithName:@"helvetica" size:40.0f];
C4Font *larger  = [initial fontWithSize:80.0f];
----

...or, to change an individual font's size:

[source]
----
C4Font *initial = [C4Font fontWithName:@"helvetica" size:40.0f];
initial  = [initial fontWithSize:80.0f];
----
