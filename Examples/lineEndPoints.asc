Once a line has been added to the canvas, its position can be changed by adjusting its end points.

PointA, PointB
--------------
All lines have two properties called _pointA_ and _pointB_ which specify the beginning and end points of the line. These points can be changed on the fly, after the line has been added to the screen.

line.pointA = ...;
line.pointB = ...;

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
If you create a horizontal line, add it to the screen and then change its _pointB_, you will see that it isn't horizontal anymore...

Here we take the end point of a horizontal line and place it at the center of the canvas.

----
CGPoint linePoints[2] = { CGPointMake(100, 100),CGPointMake(300, 100);
C4Shape *line = [C4Shape line:linePoints];
line.pointB = self.canvas.center;
