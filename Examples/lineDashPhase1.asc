You can easily animate the offset of a line's dash pattern.

Dash Phase
----------
Each shape object has a `dashPhase` property that defines _where the dash patterns starts_ along a line, and can be set by specifying a `CGFloat` value.

This property is animatable, and can be animated changed in the following way:

[source]
----
line.animationDuration = 1.0f;
line.lineDashPhase = 0.5f;
----
