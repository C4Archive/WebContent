Create an HSB color using the UIColor +colorWithHue:saturation:brightness:alpha:+ method. This method lets you specify color values for each component using a float number from 0 to 1 for each component.

TIP: In C4, an RGB value of 255 = 1.0f, 128 = 0.5f, ... If you like to work with RGB values, you can use RGBtoFloat(num) method to convert for you.

Red, Green and Blue
-------------------
With 1.0 being the full color value for a component, you can see how to create red, green and blue colors with the following code:

[source]
----
red   = [UIColor colorWithHue:0.00 saturation:1.0 brightness:1.0 alpha:1.0];
green = [UIColor colorWithHue:0.33 saturation:1.0 brightness:1.0 alpha:1.0];
blue  = [UIColor colorWithHue:0.66 saturation:1.0 brightness:1.0 alpha:1.0];
----

TIP: An alpha value of 1.0f means completely opaque, with 0.0f being completely transparent.
