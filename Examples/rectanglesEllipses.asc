You create a rectangle or an ellipse by defining a space using a *CGRect* structure, into which the shape will be drawn. Rectangles, squares, circles and ellipses are created in the exact same way.

Rectangles
----------
To define a rectangle, you create an object like this:

[source]
----
CGRect space = CGRectMake(x,y,width,height);
C4Shape *rectangle = [C4Shape rect:space];
----

To define a square, all you do is make sure that the width and height are the same value...

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create rectangle starting at (0,0), with a width of 200, and a height of 100 you do the following:

[source]
----
CGRect space = CGRectMake(0,0,200,100);
C4Shape *rectangle = [C4Shape rect:space];
----

Alternatively, you can collapse the above into one line

[source]
----
C4Shape *rectangle = [C4Shape rect:CGRectMake(0,0,200,100)];
----

Ellipses
--------
To define an ellipse, you create an object like this:

[source]
----
CGRect space = CGRectMake(x,y,width,height);
C4Shape *ellipse = [C4Shape ellipse:space];
----

To define a circle, all you do is make sure that the width and height are the same value...
