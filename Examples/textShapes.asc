You can create shapes that look like text by using a font and a string. Text shapes have the same kinds of properties and characteristics as regular shapes and lines, the only difference being that they look like words and characters.

Create a Font
-------------
You will use a font to determine the size and outline of your shape, so we first create one using any of the system fonts. A list of available names can be found at: http://www.iosfonts.com[iOS Fonts]. For more, check out the link:fonts.php[Fonts Tutorial].

C4Font *font = [C4Font fontWithName:@"..." size:...];

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create an 80 point Helvetica font you could do the following:

[source]
----
C4Font *helvetica = [C4Font fontWithName:@"helvetica" size:80.0f];
----

Text Shapes
-----------
Text shapes are very easy to make, you simply pass a string.

Basically, a bunch of text between quotes that follow an @ sign... *@"like this"* and a font.

----
C4Shape *textShape = [C4Shape shapeFromString:@"..." withFont:...];

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a text shape with the Helvetica 80pt font we created above, you could do the following:

[source]
----
C4Font *helvetica  = [C4Font fontWithName:@"helvetica" size:80.0f];
C4Shape *textShape = [C4Shape shapeFromString:@"A TEXT SHAPE" withFont:helvetica];
