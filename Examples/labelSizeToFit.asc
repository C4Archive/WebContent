When a label's frame doesn't fit with the size of its text, an easy fix is to call its `sizeToFit` method.

Create a Label
--------------
First, create a label with a really small frame (to make sure that the text won't fit).

[source]
----
C4Font *customFont = [C4Font fontWithName:@"AmericanTypewriter" size:20.0f];
label = [C4Label labelWithText:@"Hello C4" font:customFont frame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 10, 10)];
----

Resize the Label
----------------
When you're ready to resize the label to fit its text, all you have to do is the following:

[source]
----
[label sizeToFit];
----

You can try putting the above line of code inside the `touchesBegan` method and then touch the canvas to trigger the change.
