The easiest way to create a movie is to specify its file name (after you've dragged it into your Xcode project).

Create A Movie
--------------
When a movie is in your Xcode project you can create a C4Movie by passing its entire filename.

[source]
----
C4Movie *movie = [C4Image movieNamed:@"inception.mov"];
----

Playing The Movie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default movies to not automatically play, but a simple call will get them rolling...

[source]
----
[movie play];
----

.inception?
[NOTE]
When you create a new C4 project in Xcode, a short clip of the movie Inception is included to be used as a test file throughout examples and other projects. This file can also be deleted from your project and others used, if you first drag them into the files panel on the left side of the Xcode window.
