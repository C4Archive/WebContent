There are several line break modes that you can specify for a label, here we show you how to work with _character wrapping_.

Create a Label
--------------
First, create a label with a really long text and set it up. For a more detailed explanation of the following code, check out the link:labelParagraphs.php[paragraphs] example.

----
label = [C4Label labelWithText:@"... a very long text ..."];
label.frame = CGRectMake(0,0,300,600);
label.numberOfLines = 100;
----

Character Wrap
--------------
Applying the `LABELCHARWRAP` property will cause the label to break its words at individual characters without preserving the readability of the text... It won't truncate words or text to make a better fit.

----
label.lineBreakMode = LABELCHARWRAP;
