Let's say you already have a color and you want to change its transparency, there is a nice method for doing so. This method lets you create a copy of the color with a new alpha value, rather than rebuilding the color like you might by using the link:colorRGBA.php[RGBA] or link:colorHSBA.php[HSBA] techniques

Color With Alpha
----------------
You use the UIColor +colorWithAlphaComponent:+ method for creating a new color with a new transparency value.

Copying A Color
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to copy an a color and use it elsewhere, but with a different transparency, you can do the following:

[source]
----
UIColor *c = [UIColor ...];
shape.fillColor = c;
shape.strokeColor = [c colorWithAlphaComponent:0.5f]
----

AND! Even the following will work:

[source]
----
shape.fillColor = [C4RED colorWithAlphaComponent:0.5f];
----

Changing a Color's Alpha
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to change the transparency of a color you're already using, you can do the following:

[source]
----
shape.fillColor = [shape.fillColor colorWithAlphaComponent:0.5f];
