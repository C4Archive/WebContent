You can easily start and stop a GL object animating with two simple messages..

Animation Control
-----------------
We have built the C4GL object to be able to start and stop rendering... This will give you more control over your GL objects so that you can help decide whether or not your application will be constantly rendering.

Start
~~~~~
By default a GL object will not animate. To start animation do the following:

[source]
----
[gl startAnimation];
----

Stop
~~~~
To stop a GL object from animating, do the following:

[source]
----
[gl stopAnimation];
----

.On Framerates
[NOTE]
Because mobile devices have limited battery life and cpu strength, one of the major design considerations for C4 is to be computationally less intensive. One of the ways the framework does this is by _limiting_ the framerate of the application. Most of the time there is NO framerate for controlling animations and updates. However, OpenGL needs a framerate for updating...
