You can change the text of a label on the fly. When you do so it will change immediately (i.e. there is no animation for changing text).

Create a Label
--------------
First, create a label.

[source]
----
C4Font *customFont = [C4Font fontWithName:@"AmericanTypewriter" size:50.0f];
label = [C4Label labelWithText:@"Hello There C4" font:customFont];
----

Change the Text
---------------
When you're ready to change the text all you have to do is the following:

[source]
----
label.text = @"This text is a bit longer.";
----

You can try putting the above line of code inside the `touchesBegan` method and then touch the canvas to trigger the change.
