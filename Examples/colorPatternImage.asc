You can easily *use an image as a color*.

Color With Pattern Image
------------------------
To create a color with a pattern image, you need to first create a C4Image, and then use its UIImage property as the object for creating a color.

[source]
----
C4Image *img = [C4Image imageNamed:@"pattern.png"];
UIColor *patternColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:img.UIImage];
----

.Not Only C4Image!
[NOTE]
You don't have to use a C4Image for this technique, you could also build a native UIImage object and use that instead. Either way, you'll first have to create an image object to use as the pattern.
