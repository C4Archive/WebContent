The two basic colors for any shape are _fillColor_ and _strokeColor_.

Fill Color
----------
The fill color can be set by specifying a _C4Color_ or a _UIColor_. The default fill color for all shapes is *C4BLUE*.

shape.fillColor = ...;

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a circle with a *C4GREY* fill color:

[source]
----
C4Shape *circle = [C4Shape ellipse:CGRectMake(0,0,200,200)];
circle.fillColor = C4GREY;
----

Stroke Color
------------
The stroke color can be set equally as easily. The default stroke color for all shapes is C4RED.

[source]
----
shape.strokeColor = ...;
----

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a circle with a green *UIColor* stroke color:

[source]
----
C4Shape *circle = [C4Shape ellipse:CGRectMake(0,0,200,200)];
circle.fillColor = [UIColor greenColor];
