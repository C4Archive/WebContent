Arcs and wedges are created by specifying a bunch of characteristics for the shape, like its _center_ point, _radius_ and so on. Both arcs and wedges are made the same way, only differing in, well, that a wedge is an arc with an extra point.

Arcs
----
To define an arc you specify its _center_, _radius_, _start/end angles_ and whether or not it should run _clockwise_. The shape of an arc is always determined by tracing part of a circle, so the _center_ of the arc is really the center of the circle that the arc traces. 

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create arc whose center is positioned at the center of the screen, you might do this:

[source]
----
C4Shape *arc = [C4Shape arcWithCenter:self.canvas.center
                               radius:150
                           startAngle:QUARTER_PI
                             endAngle:HALF_PI + QUARTER_PI
                            clockwise:YES];
[self.canvas addShape:arc];
----

Wedges
------
You make a wedge in the exact same way as you make an arc. The only difference is that the wedge shape will draw edges reaching back to its center point.

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a wedge whose center is positioned at the center of the screen, you might do this:

[source]
----
C4Shape *wedge = [C4Shape wedgeWithCenter:self.canvas.center
                                   radius:150
                               startAngle:0
                                 endAngle:HALF_PI
                                clockwise:YES];
[self.canvas addShape:wedge];
