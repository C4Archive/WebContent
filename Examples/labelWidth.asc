You can easily change the width of a label.

Width
-----
You might want to change the width of a label so that it fits a particular design... If the text of the label is short, then the label will be larger than the text. However, if the text is long and you shorten the width from its original size, the label will truncate (i.e. it will add a "..." so that the text appears to fit).
