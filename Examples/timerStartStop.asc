One advantage of using C4Timers instead of NSTimer is that you can easily start and stop them.

C4 v. NS
--------
The C4Timer object encapsulates an NSTimer and provides from convenience methods for working with timers. Just getting the effect of starting and stopping an NSTimer can be tricky, so we've created two simple methods called +start+ and +stop+ to help you control your timers.

Start
~~~~~
You can call this method on *any* C4Timer, but you _have_ to call this on a timer that is either stopped or hasn't started yet in order to get it to start firing.

A good example of when you might want to start a timer is after you create a C4Timer using one of the +timerWithInterval+ constructors.

----
timer = [C4timer timerWithInterval:0.25f target:self method:update repeats:YES];
[timer start];
----

Stop
~~~~
To stop a timer from firing you can do the following:

[source]
----
[timer stop];
