You can set a movie to play as soon as it is loaded onto the screen, by default movies do not automatically play.

Playing Automatically
---------------------
Every C4Movie has a property called `shouldAutoplay` which takes a value of `YES` or `NO` as its argument. Setting this value to `YES` after the movie has been created makes sure that it starts playing as soon as it becomes visible.
