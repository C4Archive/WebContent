You can decide how overlapping parts of a polygon fill differently by changing a shape's _fillRule_, specifying *FILLNORMAL* or *FILLEVENODD*.

Set the Fill Rule
-----------------
To set the fill rule of a shape's line, you simply pass one of *FILLNORMAL* or *FILLEVENODD* to the shape's _fillRule_ property.

----
shape.fillRule = ...;
----

.By Default?
[NOTE]
FILLNORMAL is the default value for all shapes.

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a polygon with even-odd fill rule you can do the following:

[source]
----
CGPoint polyPoints[7] = {
        CGPointZero,
        CGPointMake(150,-150),
        CGPointMake(200,-100),
        CGPointMake(100,0),
        CGPointMake(0,-100),
        CGPointMake(50,-150),
        CGPointMake(200,0)
    };

//create poly1 and style it
poly1 = [C4Shape polygon:polyPoints pointCount:7];
poly1.fillRule = FILLEVENODD;
