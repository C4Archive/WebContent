There are several line break modes that you can specify for a label, here we show you how to work with _character clipping_.

Create a Label
--------------
First, create a label with a really long text and set it up. For a more detailed explanation of the following code, check out the link:labelParagraphs.php[paragraphs] example.

----
label = [C4Label labelWithText:@"... a very long text ..."];
label.frame = CGRectMake(0,0,300,600);
label.numberOfLines = 100;
----

Character Clip
--------------
Applying the `LABELCHARCLIP` property will clip the end of a label's text to its frame. This results in a label that does not have an ellipsis "..." at the end if its text is too long for the frame.

----
label.lineBreakMode = LABELCHARCLIP;
