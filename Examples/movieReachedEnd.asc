You can listen for when a movie reaches the end of its timeline, then you can do something with that...

Reached End
-----------
When a movie gets to the end of its timeline it posts a little notification called `reachedEnd` that gets broadcast throughout the app. You can listen for this message and then do something with it. 

Listen For reachedEnd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To have your app listen for the `reachedEnd` message of a movie, you can use the following technique:

[source]
----
[self listenFor:@"reachedEnd" andRunMethod:@"blip"];
----

.What The Self?
[CAUTION]
This example assumes that you're calling the `listenFor:` method somewhere inside of an object's `.m` file... The reference to `self` means the current object into which this line is coded.

Do Something
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the line of code above, we state that we want the `blip` method to run when we hear that a movie has reached its end point.

So, in order to run some code when a movie reaches its end point, we build a `blip` method and add some code for doing a fancy trick at the end of the movie.

[source]
----
-(void) blip {
    //Do Some Fancy Tricks Here
}
