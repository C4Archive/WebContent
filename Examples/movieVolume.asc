You can easily change a movie's volume.

A Movie's Volume
----------------
Each movie has a `volume` property which you can set by specifying a `GGFloat` value. The mapping between a movie's actual volume and a number is `1.0f == 100%` meaning that by giving your movie a value of `1.0f` it will play at its original volume.

movie.volume = 0.0f; //muted
movie.volume = 0.5f; //half-volume
movie.volume = 1.0f; //original volume
movie.volume = 2.0f; //200%
