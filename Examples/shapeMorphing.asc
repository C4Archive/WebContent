You can morph from one shape to another!

Morphing
--------
The animation system in C4 lets you morph between shapes. You don't have much control over what the animation looks like, but it's still kinda neat.

You can only do this *after* a shape has been created and is on the screen.

To do this you call any method to change the shape, on the shape itself.

Square to Circle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We'll start by explaining how to morph from a square to a circle.

[source]
----
C4Shape *square = [C4Shape rect:CGRectMake(0,0,100,100)];
[self.canvas addShape:square];

square.animationDuration = 2.0f;
[square ellipse:square.frame];
----

By calling the `ellipse` method on the `square` itself, after setting its animation duration to 2 seconds, you will trigger an automatic *morphing* animation.

Anything to Anything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can use the above technique to morph between any kind of shape.

[source]
----
C4Shape *s = [C4Shape line:...];
//add to canvas / set animation

[line rect: ...];
[line ellipse: ...];
[line polygon: ...];
[line shapeFromString: ... font: ...];
///etc...
----

You can morph ANY kind of shape.

NOTE: The linked code at the top of the page shows a series of chained animations that morph between all different types of C4Shapes.
