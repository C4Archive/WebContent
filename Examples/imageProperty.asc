You can easily change the contents of an image.

Image Property
--------------
You can swap the contents of an image by setting a new C4Image object for the original image's `image` property.

.uhhhhhhhh
[NOTE]
This will make sense in a second...

image.image
~~~~~~~~~~~
Every C4Image has an `image` property. You can change the contents of an image by doing something like the following:

[source]
----
C4Image *original = ...;
C4Image *another = ...;

original.image = another;
----

.what just happened????
[NOTE]
What just happened in this example is that `original.image = another;` actually copies the contents of the `another` image into the `original` image object.
