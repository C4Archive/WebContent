A label can change its font on the fly.

Create a Label
--------------
First, create a label.

[source]
----
label = [C4Label labelWithText:@"Hello There C4"];
----

Change the Font
---------------
When you're ready to change the font all you have to do is the following:

[source]
----
label.font = C4Font fontWithName:@"AmericanTypewriter" size:50.0f];
[label sizeToFit];
----

As you can see, there's an extra step. In this case, the label's font makes all the text bigger than its original size. However, this does *not* change the size of the label itself. To make sure you can see all of the text with the new font, you have to call `sizeToFit` on the label.

You can try putting the above line of code inside the `touchesBegan` method and then touch the canvas to trigger the change.
