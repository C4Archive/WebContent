iOS comes with a set of pre-installed fonts that you can use in your apps. All fonts are organized into families, and this example will show you how to list the names of each family and print them to the console.

[NOTE]
link:www.iosfonts.com[iOS Fonts] has a complete list of fonts for iOS, and shows their availability (i.e. iOS 4.3, 5.0, 6.0, etc...)

Family Name Array
-----------------
The first step to printing out the font family names available in the current version of iOS that you're working with, is to grab an array of all font families.

----
NSArray *familyNames = [C4Font familyNames];
----

Print All Names
---------------
All the names in the array are actually *NSString* objects, which means we can easily print them to the console. A simple *for* loop will help us here.

[source]
----
for(NSString *s in familyNames) {
    C4Log(s);
}
----

This loop will go through all the string values in the given array and log each one to the console.
