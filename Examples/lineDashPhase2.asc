The line dash phase is a value that tells the pattern *where to start* along the length of the line. This example shows how to animate it along the outside of a circle.

A Very Long Pattern
-------------------
We're going to use a very long pattern for our line, much longer than the circumference of the circle we're drawing. We're going to give it 628 values... [1,2,3,..,628].

[source]
----
CGFloat dashPattern[628];
int i;
for(i = 0; i < 628; i++) {
    dashPattern[i] = i+1;
    patternWidth += i;
}
----

Create and Style the Shape
--------------------------
We then create the shape, center it on the canvas and remove its fill color so that all we see is the pattern.
After this, we set the dash pattern.

[source]
----
circle = [C4Shape ellipse:CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 200)];
circle.center = self.canvas.center;
circle.lineWidth = 30.0f;
circle.fillColor = [UIColor clearColor];
[circle setDashPattern:dashPattern pointCount:1260];
----

Animate the Pattern
-------------------
When we're ready to animate the pattern we call the following method...

[source]
----
-(void)animate {
    circle.animationDuration = 180.0f;
    circle.animationOptions = AUTOREVERSE;
    circle.strokeColor = C4BLUE;
    circle.lineDashPhase = patternWidth;
}
----

The above will take 3 minutes to animate all the way to the end of the dash pattern, and finally change the color of the line to blue.
