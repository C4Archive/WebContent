Apple describes this property as "The relative location at which to begin stroking the path. Animatable." What this means is that you can set along the length of the line where the stroke begins and ends.

Stroke Start
------------
The default value for the _strokeStart_ property (i.e. the starting point of the stroke) is 0.0f, the beginning of the line. To change this property you simply set the _strokeStart_ with a value from 0.0f to 1.0f.

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To draw a stroke along a shape for only the *second* half of the shape can be done by setting the start of the stroke to the halfway point...

shape.strokeStart = 0.5f;

Stroke Start
------------
The default value for the _strokeEnd_ property (i.e. the end point of the stroke) is 1.0f, the end of the line. To change this property you simply set the _strokeEnd_ with a value from 0.0f to 1.0f.
