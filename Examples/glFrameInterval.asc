You can easily control the rate at which a GL object animates.

Frame Interval
--------------
Every C4GL object has a `frameInterval` property that you can change.

The system on iOS uses a _frame interval_ approach for controlling the framerate of OpenGL objects. Instead of specifying `gl.rate = 0.5f;` for a half-speed playback (like you would with C4Movie), you have to specify the rate in terms of _frames_. 

By default, a GL object will try to match 60 frames per second (FPS) when it is animating. Also, it's default animation frame interval is 1, meaning that for every GL frame that will, or should, occur the object will redraw. 

If you want a half-speed animation then you technically want your GL object to animate _every other frame_. In terms of frame intervals, this means 2.

Interval Equation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The interval equation looks something like this:

[source]
----
rate = interval/defaultFPS;
----

Because the default frame rate is 60, this translates to...

[source]
----
rate = interval/60;
----

So, the default animation rate of a GL object is...

[source]
----
rate = 1/60;
----

... or 1/60th of a second.

A New Interval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here's a few examples of setting the interval to help understand the nonsense above...

[source]
----
rate = 1.0f;  // 1/60th of a second, 60fps
rate = 2.0f;  // 2/60th = 1/30th of a second, 30fps
rate = 15.0f; // 15/60th = 1/4, 4fps
rate = 30.0f; // 30/60th = 1/2, 2fps
rate = 60.0f; // 60/60th = 1/1, 1fps
rate = 120.0f; // 120/60th = 2, 1 frame every 2 seconds
----

etc...

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To actually change the `frameInterval` property of a GL object, do the following:

[source]
----
gl.frameInterval = 2.0f;
----

.What's Actually Going On?
[NOTE]
In the video we're showing you, we've mapped the left side of the screen to 1, and the right side of the screen to 60... So, wherever the screen is touched the position of the touch is translated to something between 1 and 60.
