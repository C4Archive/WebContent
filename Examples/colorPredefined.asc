Rather than creating colors by specifying components with the link:colorRGBA.php[RGBA] or link:colorHSBA.php[HSBA] techniques, there are several predefined colors that you can use.

Predefined Colors
-----------------
The UIColor object currently has *15* predefined colors:

- black
- darkGray
- lightGray
- gray
- red
- green
- blue
- cyan
- yellow
- magenta
- orange
- purple
- brown
- white
- clear

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
The UIColor object has a method for each of the listed colors. To use this method you have to call +[UIColor xColor]+ where the _x_ can be replaced by the name of a color. For instance, +[UIColor redColor]+ or +[UIColor orangeColor]+...
