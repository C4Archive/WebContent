You can show multiple lines of text in a label by increasing the value of its _numberOfLines_ property.

Number of Lines
---------------
Every C4Label starts out by showing a single line of text. You can change this by setting the _numberOfLines_ property to something higher than 1. The effects of this change only show up when the *frame* of the label has enough space to accommodate more than one line.

The following example sets up a label with enough space for 3 lines of text.

----
C4Font *customFont = [C4Font fontWithName:@"AmericanTypewriter" size:50.0f];
C4Label *label = [C4Label labelWithText:@"Hello There C4" font:customFont];
label.width = 200.0f;
label.height = 200.0f;
label.numberOfLines = 3.0f;

.without 3 lines?
[NOTE]
Try running this example without setting its _numberOfLines_ property and you'll see the difference.
