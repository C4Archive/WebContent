There are a *LOT* of different ways to create colors in C4. You can use the link:C4Colors.php[C4 colors] (from the logo), you can use the link:colorPredefined.php[predefined] UIColors, you can create link:colorRGBA.php[RGB] or link:colorHSBA[HSB] colors, you can use link:colorPatternImage.php[pattern images] as colors... 

So, there's a lot to choose from...

This example shows basic use of all the different types of colors.

Default Colors
--------------
The default colors for any shape that you create are *C4BLUE* for the _fillColor_ and *C4RED* for the _strokeColor_.

[source]
----
shape.fillColor = C4BLUE;
shape.strokeColor = C4RED;
----

C4 Colors
---------
There are 3 C4 Colors, which match those from the logo. They are: 
. *C4RED*
. *C4Blue*
. *C4GREY*.

You can use them like this:

[source]
----
shape.fillColor = C4RED;
shape.strokeColor = C4GREY;
----

Predefined Colors
-----------------
You can use any of the link:colorPredefined.php[predefined] UIColors, like this:

[source]
----
shape.fillColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
shape.strokeColor = [UIColor darkGrayColor];
----

RGB(A) Colors
-------------
You can create link:colorRGBA.php[RGB colors] by using the UIColor +colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha:+ method.

[source]
----
shape.fillColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.50 green:1.0 blue:0.0 alpha:1.0];
shape.strokeColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.50 green:0.0 blue:0.0 alpha:1.0]
----

.What's that 1.0f?
[NOTE]
Remember that all the color values in C4 are actually mapped from 0 to 1, rather than 0 to 255 like in some other APIs. In C4,  an RGB value of 255 = 1.0f, 128 = 0.5f, ... If you like to work with RGB values, you can use the RGBtoFloat() method to convert for you.

HSB(A) Colors
-------------
You can create link:colorHSBA.php[HSB colors] by using the UIColor +colorWithHue:saturation:brightness:alpha:+ method.

[source]
----
shape.fillColor = [UIColor colorWithHue:0.5 saturation:1.0 brightness:1.0 alpha:1.0];
shape.strokeColor = [UIColor colorWithHue:0.25 saturation:0.75 brightness:0.5 alpha:1.0];
----

White Colors
------------
You easily specify greyscale colors with the UIColor +colorWithWhite:alpha:+ method (with 1.0f being white, and 0.0f being black). 

[source]
----
shape.fillColor = [UIColor colorWithWhite:0.5 alpha:1.0];
shape.strokeColor = [UIColor colorWithWhite:0.33 alpha:1.0];
----

System Colors
-------------
There are several link:colorSystem.php[system colors] that OSX uses, that you can use as well.

[source]
----
shape.fillColor = [UIColor scrollViewTexturedBackgroundColor];
shape.strokeColor = [UIColor darkTextColor];
----

Alpha Colors
------------
All colors, no matter what type they are, can be used to create copies of themselves with different link:colorWithAlpha.php[alpha values].

[source]
----
rect.fillColor = [rect.fillColor colorWithAlphaComponent:0.5];
rect.strokeColor = [rect.strokeColor colorWithAlphaComponent:0.5];
----

Pattern Image Colors
--------------------
It is actually possible to create colors using link:colorPatternImage.php[patterns and images]. The UIColor +colorWithPatternImage:+ method allows you to easily apply an image as a fill, or stroke to a shape or any other object that has a color property.

[source]
----
C4Image *fillPattern = [C4Image imageNamed:@"pyramid.png"];
shape.fillColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:fillPattern.UIImage];

C4Image *strokePattern = [C4Image imageNamed:@"pattern.png"];
shape.strokeColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:strokePattern.UIImage];
