You can pause and play a movie easily with two simple messages.

Playback
--------
Playing and pausing a movie is very easy. In essence, the +*pause*+ message sets the movie's playback rate to 0, where play sets it to 1.0 (normal playback rate).

.Playback Rate?
[NOTE]
Each movie has a rate property, which controls the speed of the movie. This rate can be positive or negative. For more on how to use this property see the link:movieRate.php[Movie Rate] tutorial.
