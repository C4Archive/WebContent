You can easily have a GL object draw a single frame.

Controlled Animation
--------------------
Let's say you want to have a bit more control over your GL object, and that you want to determine _when_ it draws frames rather than letting it decide for itself by calling its `startAnimation` method.

drawOnce
~~~~~~~~
Each C4GL object has a `drawOnce` property you can set to either `YES` or `NO` with `NO` being the default value. This property will stop the object after it draws a single frame. 

So, if you have some update logic in your renderer, this property will actually all the object draw the _next_ frame in your animation and then *stop* it afterwards.

To use this property you do the following:

----
gl.drawOnce = YES;
[gl startAnimation];
