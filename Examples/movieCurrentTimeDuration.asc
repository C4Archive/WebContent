You can easily access a movie's current time and its total duration.

Duration
--------
Each movie has a `duration` property which will return its total length as a float value, measured in seconds. 

[source]
----
CGFloat duration = movie.duration;
----

Current Time
------------
Each movie has a `currentTime` property which will return its current position along its timeline, measured in seconds.

[source]
----
CGFloat currentTime = movie.currentTime;
----

.How Do I Use This?
[NOTE]
To display the current time on screen, as a movie is playing, you'll have to set up a label that you'll then update using a C4Timer. The gist linked to this example will show you how we achieved this effect.
