You can choose from one of 3 different cap styles for the ends of a line, these are *CAPBUTT*, *CAPSQUARE* and *CAPROUND*. The first two options will create square ends for your lines, the difference being that CAPSQUARE will extend past the end of the line just a little bit. The CAPROUND option will also extend past the ends of the line.

Set the Cap Style
-----------------
To set the cap style of a shape's line, you simply pass one of *CAPBUTT*, *CAPSQUARE* or *CAPROUND* to the shape's _lineCap_ property.

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a line from {100,100} to {300,100} with a round cap style you could do the following:

[source]
----
CGPoint endPoints[2] = {CGPointMake(100,100),CGPointMake(300,100)};
C4Shape *line = [C4Shape line:endPoints];
line.lineCap = CAPROUND;
