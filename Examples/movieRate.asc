You can easily change a movie's playback rate in real-time.

The Rate
--------
Each movie has a `rate` property that lets you control its playback speed. To set a movie's rate you simply give it a `CGFloat` value. A rate of `0.0f` means that playback is stopped, anything greater than this plays the movie forward, and vice-versa.

Forwards
~~~~~~~~
To play a movie forwards you specify any value _greater than zero_. A value of `1.0f` will give you normal playback.

----
movie.rate = 0.5f; //half-speed forward
movie.rate = 1.0f; //regular playback
movie.rate = 2.0f; //fast forward
----

Backwards
~~~~~~~~~
To play a movie backwards you specify any value _less than zero_. A value of `-1.0f` will give you backwards playback at normal speed.

[source]
----
movie.rate = -0.5f; //half-speed backwards
movie.rate = -1.0f; //backwards at regular playback speed
movie.rate = -2.0f; //fast backward

.What's Going On Here?
[NOTE]
In the linked code example (i.e. the one shown in the movie) we've mapped the right side of the screen to trigger `movie.rate = 1.0f;` and the left side to trigger `movie.rate = -1.0f;` with every other point on screen being mapped between these two values.
