You can change the thickness of a line by setting its _lineWidth_ property. We'll walk through an example of setting the width of a line, but the same technique can be used for all other shapes, including text.

Set the Width
-------------
To set the width of a shape's line, you simply pass a number (greater than 0) to the shape's _lineWidth_ property.

----
shape.lineWidth = ...;

In Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~
To create a circle with a line width of 100 you could do the following:

[source]
----
C4Shape *circle = [C4Shape ellipse:CGRectMake(0,0,200,200)];
circle.lineWidth = 100.0f;
