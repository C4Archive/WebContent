You can set a movie to loop as soon as it is reaches the end of its timeline.

Looping
-------
Every C4Movie has a property called `loops` which takes a value of `YES` or `NO` as its argument. Setting this value to `YES` makes sure that it jumps back to the begging of its timeline when it reaches its end.
