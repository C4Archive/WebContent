You can set a dash pattern for the line of any C4Shape.

Pattern Concept
---------------
You create a pattern by specifying a series of numbers which become the widths of the dashes and gaps in the pattern. These numbers are sequential and ordered such that the first number is a dash, the second is a gap, and so on... _dash_ _gap_ _dash_ _gap_... Patterns will also repeat.

For instance, the following will make a uniform pattern where all dashes are 5 points wide, and all gaps are 10 points wide.

+5, 10+

Turns into...

+5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, ...+ for the length of the line.

An odd-numbered pattern like the following will also repeat, but the gaps and dashes will be slightly different than above

+5, 10, 5+

Turns into...

+5, 10, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5, 10, 5, ...+ for the length of the line.

C-Array Patterns
----------------
The easiest way to create a pattern for a line is to use a C-Array of *CGFloat* values.

----
CGFloat pattern[2] = {5,10};
[line setDashPattern:pattern pointCount:2];

.Familiar?
[NOTE]
The technique for setting a dash pattern is similar to creating a polygon. You give the object your pattern and also have to specify the number of points in the pattern.

NSArray Patterns
----------------
When you create a pattern using the +setDashPattern:+ method, what happens under the hood is that the shape actually turns the C-Array into an NSArray of number objects.

So, although the following technique is a bit longer it is actually the proper way of setting a dash pattern.

[source]
----
NSArray *patternArray = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:
                         [NSNumber numberWithInt:5],
                         [NSNumber numberWithInt:10],
                         [NSNumber numberWithInt:5],
                         nil];
line.lineDashPattern = patternArray;
