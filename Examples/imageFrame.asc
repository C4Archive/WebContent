You can distort an image by changing its frame, when you do so the original ratio is *not* preserved, unlike when you change its link:imageHeight.php[height] and link:imageWidth.php[width].

Image Frame
-----------
The following will scale and distort an image so that it completely fills the canvas.

[source]
----
image.frame = self.canvas.frame;
----

You can also create your own frame (a CGRect) into which an image can be distorted.

[source]
----
CGRect newFrame = CGRectMake(0,0,100,100);
image.frame = newFrame;
