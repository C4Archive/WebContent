To work with OpenGL in C4, you create a *C4GL* object and provide it with a _renderer_ that has drawing code. Each C4GL uses  a default renderer that draws the logo.

Create a C4GL Object
--------------------
The following will create a new C4GL object which will use the default renderer...

C4GL *gl = [C4GL glWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,200,200)];

[NOTE]
The open OpenGL coordinate system differs from C4 / Obj-C in that for a given frame the coordinates of each corner clockwise from the top-left are {-1,1}, {1,1}, {1,-1}, {-1,-1}. The C4GL object will automatically map OpenGL coordinates to its own frame. For example, if a C4GL object has a 200x200 frame, the {-1,1} = {0,0}, {1,1} = {200,0}, {1,-1} = {200,200}, {-1,-1} = {0,200}.
