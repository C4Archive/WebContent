In this tutorial we will show you how to understand a bit about our link:/examples[Examples].

Title & Preamble & TOC
----------------------
The title and preamble are fairly straightforward. The title describes the document, whereas the preamble gives you a sense of what the example entails.

The table of contents gives you links to the different sections of the page.

Visuals
-------
This section gives you a visual snapshot of what the current example. Most often this section is an image of an iPad running  an application that shows what the example is all about. When the example shows something moving or some kind of interaction, this section will be a video linked to the link:http://www.vimeo.com/c4ios[C4 Vimeo] account. In some rare cases, this section is an image of the Xcode window itself.

Writeup
-------
The writeup is broken down into 2 components: _descriptions_ and _code blocks_. 

Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Descriptions are sections of the writeup that pertain to a _single_ concept, sometimes broken down into sub-concepts. These may also contain NOTES, WARNINGS, CAUTIONS, etc...

Code Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~
Code blocks are used to _explain_ the concept of a description, and though they could be incorporated into one of your projects, they are not designed to be standalone. Moreover, they are designed to communicate the idea of what is being discussed.

Code Links
----------
At the top-right of every page there is a space where a link to a _GitHub_ or a _Gist_ respository exists. The image that you see in the example can be built and compiled from this code.

Steps to Using Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are only a couple of easy steps to use the code from an example.

. click on the link
. if it is a gist, copy the entire contents of the gist into an open C4 project in Xcode
. if it is a GitHub repo, download and open the project
. from Xcode, click the run button

What Examples Are Not
---------------------
_Examples are not tutorials!_ Examples are written to show you only the concept of a topic. The reason for this is because some examples take a lot of extra setup code to get running nicely, the details of which aren't really that interesting... So, for examples we strip the code blocks down only to the lines that matter.

_Examples are not complete code!_ Although each code block should run on its own if copied into a project, there might be some extra setup code that needs to be inserted into a C4 project before the example can run. *You should grab the linked code at the top of the page to see the example run.*
