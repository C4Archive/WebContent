You're going to need 3 things to get started: a Mac, Xcode and C4.

A Mac

C4 is a platform-specific framework, which means that if you want to work with it you'll have to get your hands on a Mac. Anything with OSX 10.7+ should make things easy, I'm currently working on 10.7 and still waiting to make sure everything's tidy before I move up to 10.8 on my macbook pro. 

.OSX 10.6
[NOTE]
You can use C4 on 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) but you have to get online and find a special copy of Xcode for everything to work. The main thing is that you run Xcode 4.3 for Snow Leopard, which you will be able to download if you have an official iOS Developer membership... You might also have to fiddle with installing iOS 5.0 or 6.0 if you run into trouble.

Xcode

link:https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode] is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) that can be used to create and deploy applications for both iOS and OSX. This is the IDE that you will need to develop any C4 project.

We are continuing to update C4 and currently support versions of Xcode 4.3 and above.

You can get a free copy of the latest Xcode from the link:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12[Mac App Store]

C4

We have created a nice little installer for you. When you run the C4 Installer, a set of files gets installed directly into Xcode. These files then give you access to a project template in Xcode that lets you build empty C4 projects. The installer also adds the C4 Docset onto your computer so that you have the complete documentation available to you right in Xcode.
