This is how we work with C4. First, we write our apps using Xcode. Second, we host our projects on GitHub. Third, we ask questions and find answers to problems on StackOverflow.

Write Code
----------

You should write your apps in Xcode... Actually, we don't think there's any other reliable way of coding and directly building for iOS devices.

Xcode makes coding easier in a lot of ways, but we won't get into those for now. For more, see our link:xcode.php[Xcode Tutorial].

Git / Share Code
----------------

Git is a great technology for versioning / making backups of your current projects, you can use Git by itself but we suggest connecting it with a GitHub account. 

Share
~~~~~
If you host your projects on GitHub and you have a problem with them, you can always point us to the current state of your project and we can have a look at what's going on. Well, we or anyone else who is helping you out with your project.

Get
~~~
We host all our examples, tutorials, code, api and so on at GitHub. So, if you ever need a copy of some code you can find it online and download it to your computer. This can be anything from snippets of code to full Xcode projects.

Ask / Find / Answer
-------------------
image::workflow/stackoverflow.png["Stack Overflow"]

Instead of a forum that we maintain, we're trying to get C4 into the greater community. So, if you ever have a problem you're facing in your project you can post it on link:stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow].

Ask
~~~
When you ask a question, make sure to add the C4 tag so that we get notified. Someone will answer your question as soon as possible.

Find
~~~~
If you're having trouble with something, you can often find the answer to your problem on S.O. before posting a question of your own. The community is active all the time, and it's quite common for someone who isn't using C4 has run into the same issue that you're having in your project... Not all problems you'll face will be C4-specific.

Answer
~~~~~~
When you're comfortable enough with S.O. you can actually answer some questions yourself. This will build your reputation and help strengthen the community.

Summary
-------
We came to this combination of 3 parts for our workflow with C4 out of necessity. 

First, sharing project code is difficult in a web / online space (like link:http://www.processing.org[Processing] does so well) because apps don't run in a browser. So, we needed a way to reliably share projects, snippets and such, without too much hassle. As well, the ability to version and save projects while keeping them public was a great opportunity and sold us on GitHub for hosting projects... It's also free, so we can upload as many projects and examples as we want.

Second, we opted against maintaing our own Forum / Wiki for a few reasons, none better than the fact that at link:http://www.stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow] there are thousands of contributers many of whom will be able to answer the questions posed by people who use C4. Simply put, the community there is _very_ strong. So, we thought it in our best interest to leverage that community and begin by _building in_ the C4 community. We hope that people using C4 might become a newer part of S.O. by bringing their creative, aesthetic and expressive approaches. 

Finally, to build iOS apps you have to use Xcode, an IDE that can be quite confusing at first. But, the benefits of using Xcode far outweigh its often cluttered interface. Some of these benefits are:

- Code completion
- Integrated Documentation (even the C4 Docs are available with a right-click of your mouse)
- Instruments (to help with debugging)
- ...
