In this tutorial, we'll orient you to the Stack Overflow (S.O.) website and how to use it for asking programming questions about C4.

The S.O. Site
-------------
You can get to the S.O. site by clicking the following link:

link:http://stackoverflow.com[S.O. Main Page]

About S.O.
~~~~~~~~~~
Stack Overflow is a free Q & A site that you can use to ask questions about C4. The site describes itself as:

[quote, S.O. Team]
____
Stack Overflow is a programming Q & A site thatâ€™s free. Free to ask questions, free to answer questions, free to read, free to index, built with plain old HTML, no fake rot13 text on the home page, no scammy google-cloaking tactics, no salespeople, no JavaScript windows dropping down in front of the answer asking for $12.95 to go away...

You can get to the About page by clicking the following link:

Why S.O.?
~~~~~~~~~
We've chosen to use Stack Overflow to moderate questions about C4 because it's a new and popular community for programming questions. The entire site is open-source and its content is generated by its users, all that content is moderated by those users as well. It's a really great community-driven site.

SO, we've decided to go with S.O. because we believe that this is a better option than maintaining our own wiki / forum / messaging board. One reason is that _anyone_ can answer questions about your project... If the question you ask is about iOS dev, or general programming topics, someone who isn't part of the C4 community can help you out. This allows a LOT of people to contribute to helping with C4 questions, and gets us out into the larger development community.

Signing Up
----------
Signing up for S.O. is pretty easy, and there are a lot of options to choose from. First, go to this link:

Your Account

You can access your account information by clicking on your account name at the top of any page. When you scroll over your account name at the top you can see a small _activity_ panel pop up to give you an overview of what you've been up to recently.

At the bottom of your account page are several areas of "metrics", basically sections that show your entire contribution to S.O. broken down into: 

- Answers
- Questions
- Reputation
- Tags
- Badges
- Accounts
- Bounties

S.O. FAQ
--------
The absolute best thing to do now is go to the S.O. FAQ and get a sense of what it's all about:

IMPORTANT: DO THIS NOW! And, DO THIS BEFORE ASKING A QUESTION!

C4 Tag on S.O.
--------------
You may have noticed that there are _tons_ of questions about programming on stack overflow. For instance, at the time this tutorial was made there were *3,615,310* different questions asked on S.O.

Fortunately, the site lets you filter through all its questions in several different ways, the easiest of which is by *tags*.

There is a C4 tag that you can follow, which will give you direct access to all the questions ever asked about C4.

About the C4 Tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every tag has its own About page that you can get to by clicking on the tag itself. The C4 About page looks like this:

Before You Ask a Question
-------------------------
Asking a question for the first time on S.O. can be a bit confusing, mainly because there is a particular style that you need to follow. This "style" is really a community-based effort to keep questions on topic and to keep the forums relevant and useful, without letting them fall into nonsense like you might find on other loosely moderated forums.

Read the FAQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, you should go through and skim the FAQ... There will be lots of information there to help you figure out how to write. And, you'll get the *Analytical* badge for visiting all sections in the FAQ.

How to Ask
~~~~~~~~~~
There is an in-depth page on how to ask questions on Stack Overflow.

Do Your Homework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first thing to do *before* asking a question is to search for the answer to your question.

So, just to a couple of searches for terms and full questions on the site to see if someone else has asked or answered your question already. 

NOTE: More often than not your question has already been asked.

Ask a Question
--------------
Ok, so you've done your homework and you're ready to ask a question. Click on the link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask[Ask Question] button at the top of any S.O. page. 

Write Your Question
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Choose an appropriate and clear title, then write your question out.

image::stackoverflow/so_askquestion.png["Ask Your Question",height=400]

Choose Some Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You *HAVE* to choose at least 1 tag for your question, the first of which should be the *C4* tag. If you don't tag your question with C4 then the C4 community won't get notified and we won't be able to answer.

When you type C4 into the Tags text field, you'll get a bunch of options. Click on the C4 option and it will add this tag to your question.

image::stackoverflow/tags.png["Choose the C4 Tag"]

Post Your Question
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you're done, hit the *Post Your Question* button at the bottom of the page.

DON'T WORRY!
------------
Don't worry about the quality of your first post. You'll pick it up quite quickly. More importantly, don't worry about people being cranky about the way you ask questions on S.O., they're really just trying to keep the forums in line. 

If needed, people will help you by suggesting clarifications which you can edit into your original post. People may even edit your post for you, without you knowing about it! There is a badge for helping keep questions clean and straightforward. 

So, *POST* and we'll answer your question for you!
