The C4 community exists in a few different places, and for good reason. We could host our own code, our own forums, and have email bulletins, but instead we tried to go a bit of a different route.

We've chosen 4 places to keep you up to date with new releases, code samples / examples / tutorials / ..., news and pictures. 

Stack Overflow
--------------

Instead of a wiki or forum that we'll be updating and maintaining, we've decided to use link:http://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow] as the place to ask questions and have discussions about programming.

About S.O.
~~~~~~~~~~
Stack Overflow is a free Q & A site that you can use to ask questions about C4. The site describes itself as:

[quote, S.O. Team]
____
Stack Overflow is a programming Q & A site thatâ€™s free. Free to ask questions, free to answer questions, free to read, free to index, built with plain old HTML, no fake rot13 text on the home page, no scammy google-cloaking tactics, no salespeople, no JavaScript windows dropping down in front of the answer asking for $12.95 to go away...

The C4 Tag
~~~~~~~~~~
Every question asked on S.O. has at least one, but usually several tags associated with it. The C4 Framework has its own tag, which you can check out here: link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c4[C4 on S.O.]

You can read all the other posts about C4, upvote them, contribute to answers and so on... 

When you ask a question about C4 you can tag it and the rest of the C4 community will get a little notification. We're pretty eager to answer questions that pop up, so you should get a response fairly quickly.

S.O. Tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We've written a tutorial for getting started with Stack Overflow. There are a few steps to getting up and running with the site, though nothing to daunting. 

We also describe a few things like setting up a logo (using Gravatar if you want), and the etiquette for asking questions and posting answers.

GitHub can be a bit confusing at times, but there are only a few basics that you'll need to know. So, we've written a tutorial for getting you up to speed on grabbing projects, finding examples and contributing your comments / issues.
