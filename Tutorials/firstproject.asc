In this tutorial, we'll take you through the steps of creating your first C4 project. In the end you'll have built a simple - only a white screen - but full iOS app.

Creating a Project
------------------
The first step to creating a new C4 project is to open Xcode. If you're running OSX 10.7, Xcode should be in your Applications folder.

Welcome Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll should be presented with a welcome window with some options for creating new projects, or opening old ones. Click on the *Create a new Xcode project* button to the left of the window.

WARNING: If you don't have Xcode, or you haven't installed C4, you need to go through the link:gettingstarted.php[Getting Started] tutorial.

Select the C4 Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first step is to choose the kind of project you want to build. Xcode provides you with a lot of options, but you should choose the *C4 Single View Application*, under the iOS / Application section.

IMPORTANT: If you followed the link:gettingstarted.php[Getting Started] tutorial and you don't see this option, then something went wrong with the installer. We suggest emailing us directly about the problem and we can help you figure out how to get running. Click on the author's name at the top of this tutorial page, it should a _mailto_ link that takes you to your email client.

Naming Your Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next, you'll be presented with a panel that lets you choose options for your project. The first thing to do is to type in a project name, here we use the name _myProject_.

Choose a device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You next have to choose the specific device you want to build an app for, and the choices are either *iPad* or *iPhone*. So, select one of those two options, and then hit *Next*.

WARNING:DO NOT choose the Universal option... As of Sept. 2012 this option is currently unavailable even though it looks like you can choose it... Making project templates in Xcode is quite complicated, but we're working on getting a Universal option sometime later this year.

Class Prefix
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There's an option to add a *class prefix* for your project. *make sure this is blank*

.CLASS PREFIX (17/09/2012)
[WARNING]
MAKE SURE THE CLASS PREFIX FIELD REMAINS EMPTY. I will build a new version of the installer that can handle this better.

Choose a Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally, you're given the opportunity to save the project anywhere on your computer. Choose a location and then hit the *Create* button.

Cleaning up Xcode
-----------------
When Xcode first opens the window is pretty noisy, there are a bunch of panels that we don't need, and the current file selected is the project, which shows a bunch of information that's not really important _at the moment_.

Hide the Utilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hide the Utilities panel (on the right) by clicking the rightmost _view_ button at the top-right of the Xcode window.

When you've done that, you'll be left with a view that shows only the project details.

Choose C4WorkSpace.m
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From the file list on the left, choose the +*C4Workspace.m*+ file, this will be the main place that you will be working with C4.

Roll Up Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Optionally, you can roll up all the folders on the left panel...

Build and Launch
----------------
Now it's time to build and launch your first C4 app (which is actually a native iOS app). Simply click on the *RUN* button at the top-left of the Xcode window and your project should launch.

NOTE: You should see your project open up in the iOS Simulator. If you have an iOS device plugged in, and you have an Apple Developer account, then you can change the Scheme (just to the right of the run button) from iOS Simulator to your device and your app should launch on your device.
