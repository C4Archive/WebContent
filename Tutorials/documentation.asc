We've designed the documentation for C4 to integrate into Xcode and be as similar as possible to Apple's documentation. This tutorial will help you understand how to navigate both our and Apple's documentation, show you where to and how look for things.

Orientation
-----------
First, there is a lot of documentation available form Apple on top of which we here at C4 have tried to add a lot of our own documentation.

Second, you can access documentation directly through Xcode or by going to the link:/documentation/[C4 Documenation] or the link:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/[iOS Developer Library]. 

Third, documentation and development resources come in all kinds of formats including docsets, html, pdf, project files, sample code, notes, videos.

Where To Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All the content you can find online – from both us and Apple - _can be accessed through Xcode_. So, we're going to focus this tutorial on accessing content via the _Documentation Organizer_.

What To Look For
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most reliable source for figuring out what various classes can do, which methods work, and so on will be the official documentation. Tutorials, examples and walkthroughs, and C4-specific material will be available here on the C4 site.

What To Do Next
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just follow along with this tutorial. The main thing is for you get oriented to the basic components of the organizer. Afterwards, you can then start reading docs, finding projects and so on... After a while _things will get easier and more intuitive_.

The Organizer
-------------
Xcode has a viewer that provides you access that manages documentation and helps you find C4 and Apple documentation resources. There are 4 main components to the organizer that you will use most regularly, they're highlighted in the image below.

Open It
~~~~~~~
Open the organizer from Xcode's menu, *Window > Organizer*...

image::documentation/organizerMenu.png["Menu access"]

...Or, by clicking on the button in the top-right part of the main Xcode window...

Navigator Selector Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can switch between different types of navigation for finding content in the organizer. The two main options that you should use are the _browse_ and _search_ modes.

image::documentation/browseAndSearch.png["Browse And Search"]

Navigator Area
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is where the results of your searching and browsing appear. You use this space for either scrolling through documentation, organized hierarchically in the browse mode, or by selecting various documents and resources returned to you by your search.

Content Jump Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The jump bar in the content area allows you to further explore the document and the library it’s in by clicking on the current document's ancestors.

Content Area
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The current document you've chosen will appear here.

Browsing
--------
Use the browse navigator in the documentation organizer to explore installed documentation sets and find documents relevant to your development needs.

Documentation is provided in documentation sets (doc sets) and organized hierarchically into categories by technology. A category can contain any or all documentation resource types—guides, references, and sample code, for example. Each item in the navigation is generally classified into one of the following:

- Library (doc set)
- Category or conceptual document
- API reference document
- Sample code project
- Document page or section
- Help article

You can choose an item at any level of the hierarchy (library, category, document, or section) to view the corresponding page in the content area. Choose a category, for example, to browse a topic page with details about each document in that category, including a content description, change summary, and publication date.

TIP: To open the selected document in your browser, Control-click in the content area and choose Open Page in Browser.

Searching
---------
You can search developer documentation to locate information specific to your immediate needs. Searching can be the fastest way to find the exact documentation you need.

In the following example, one result for the search term +beat+ is an item for the function +MusicSequenceGetSecondsForBeats+, identified by the _f_ icon:

C4 Documentation
----------------
When you install C4 on your computer, one of the files that gets installed is the C4 docset. This file is placed in a directory that Xcode recognizes, and as such, it becomes integrated into the documentation organizer.

Browsing C4 Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Browsing C4 documentation is the same process as for Apple docs. Open the navigator, click on the browse icon, then select the C4 Documentation button from the navigator area.

A full list of classes, protocols and categories will appear in the Navigator area. As well, the main page of the docset will appear in the content area. From here, you can browse through the C4 API.

Searching C4 Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You search for C4 documentation in the normal way. Click the search icon, type in a word and results begin to appear. Simple. 

Other Tricks
------------
There are a few other tricks to finding documentation that are available when you're working directly in the Xcode window.

Quick Help
~~~~~~~~~~
While you're coding you might want to quickly check the documentation for a word. Instead of jumping to the organizer, typing something in, finding the document and then navigating to the part you want to read, there is a much easier option... To use *Quick Help*, do the following:

. Place your cursor over the word you want to check, then...
. option-click

A popover will appear with the documentation specific for that word.

You can do this for *classes*...

image::documentation/quickHelpClass.png["Quick Help for Classes"]

...for *methods*... 

image::documentation/quickHelpMethod.png["Quick Help for Methods"]

...and for *properties*...

Jump to Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For those of you who like to go straight to raw header documentation, you can jump to a word's *definition* by doing the following:

. Place your cursor over the word you want to check, then...
. control-click
. select _Jump to Definition_

image::documentation/jumpToDefinition.png["Jump To Definition"]

...or simply

. command-click

...either way will bring you to the point in a header (*.h*) file where that word is defined.
