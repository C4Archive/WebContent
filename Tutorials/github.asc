In this tutorial, we'll orient you to the GitHub website and how to use it for finding and sharing code. But, first and foremost, _GitHub is the best way for you to share code with the C4 Community_.

The GitHub Site
---------------
You can get to the GitHub site by clicking the following link:

link:https://github.com[GitHub Main Page]

WARNING: If you haven't ever set up GIT on your computer, or if you don't know, then you should stop right here and follow along the link:https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git[Setting Up Git] tutorial from GitHub.

About GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~
GitHub is a free, open-source site for hosting and sharing code, and working remotely / together with people on projects.

[quote, GitHub Team]
____
GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over a million people use GitHub to build amazing things together.

Why Github?
~~~~~~~~~~~
We've chosen to use GitHub to host our projects, code and snippets for a lot of reasons. Foremost, we use it in our daily workflow for adding features and refining C4, because it allows us to easily version and save the project. Furthermore, because the project is open-source GitHub also allows _you_ to download the most up to date version of C4 at any time.

GitHub also has some really interesting components to it, like the ability to store whole projects, or to store _snippets_ of code as *Gists*. When a project is public and placed on GitHub _anyone_ can download it, which means that if you link:stackoverflow.php[Ask A Question] and link to your current project on GitHub we can download and toy around with it for you before answering.

There are more reasons, but the main GitHub page says it all... At the time of writing this tutorial, there are _over 2 million people_ currently sharing _over 3.6 million projects_ online.

Sign Up
-------
First things first, sign up for GitHub by clicking on the _Signup and Pricing_ button at the top of the main page. 

image::github/gh_plans.png["GitHub Plans", height=400]

The Free Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GitHub has a nice concept... Private accounts cost money, whereas free accounts require code to be open-source.

Sign yourself up for a *free* account.

image::github/gh_freeaccount.png["GitHub Plans", height=400]

...Then log in.

Your Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you've logged in you'll be taken to your main account page, if you don't see this page then simply click on your account name at the top of the page you're currently on.

Home Page
~~~~~~~~~
Your GitHub home page has a few things for you to check out, including a space for notifications, a short list of your repositories, and an long list of notifications. You can also navigate a to several places including actions, pull requests, issues and so on...

image::github/gh_home.png["Your GitHub Home Page", height=400]

BootCamp
--------
From your home page you can see a big area called Bootcamp. This is a great place to learn how to set up git on your computer, create a repository, fork a repo, and how to use their social network to watch projects and follow people. 

So, if you're new to Git we suggest you walk through the bootcamp to get situated.

NOTE: GIT can get confusing, and so can GitHub, so from time to time I revisit these walkthroughs... They're great for covering the basics again and again.

C4 On GitHub
------------
There are 4 different accounts for C4 on GitHub, but you don't need to remember all of them. In fact, most of the time you'll just click a button on our website which will take you straight to a repository without you needing to know with which account it is associated.

But, just to let you know, the 4 accounts are the following:

- C4Framework
- C4Examples
- C4Tutorials
- C4Code

C4Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~
This account is where the core API is hosted, so if you want access to the latest builds you can find them here. A lot of the code that on this repo will be experimental but will eventually be incorporated into the files included in the installer.

This account also has a repo for the structure of the installer.

- link:https://github.com/C4Framework[C4Framework]

C4Examples
~~~~~~~~~~
This account hosts all of the code, both projects and gists, that you can access from any one of the *example* pages on our website.

- link:https://github.com/C4Examples[C4Examples]

C4Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~
This account hosts all of the code, both projects and gists, that you can access from any one of the *tutorial* pages on our website.

- link:https://github.com/C4Tutorials[C4Tutorials]

C4Code
~~~~~~
This account hosts any code that isn't associated with the framework, or the examples / tutorials. It is a place where we can upload code, test, answers to people's problems and so on. The code hosted here will work when it is uploaded, but _will not be updated_ for new releases and so on...

- link:https://github.com/C4Code[C4Code]

Gists
-----
There are 2 ways to host code on GitHub. The typical way is to have projects up online, where the entire structure of the project is held. For instance, the C4Framework repo for the core API (link:https://github.com/C4Framework/C4iOS[C4iOS]) contains all the files necessary for a complete Xcode project.

Sometimes this is _overkill_.

image::github/gist.png["Gist", height=400]

gist.github.com
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we want to share short _snippets_ of code that can be run in a typical C4 project, we will upload our examples as *Gists*.

Gists exist at link:https://gist.github.com[gist.github.com], and for each different account you add the appropriate extension. 

C4Examples on Gist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most examples on our website will be hosted as gists and can be found at:

- link:https://gist.github.com/C4Examples[C4Examples on Gist]

Currently there are approximately *120* examples hosted on gist (not all of which have their own page on our website, yet).

image::github/c4examples.png["List of Examples on Gist",height=400]

What a Gist Looks Like
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you go to a gist, you basically see a window with a title, options for editing, downloading or starring the file, and at least one frame that contains code.

Grab GitHub Code
----------------
Okay, so this is a long tutorial, but we've finally made it to the meat. The point is to show you how to get code from GitHub. There are several ways, but we'll show you the easiest here. 

Every Git repo has the following bar at the top of its main page:

image::github/gh_getcode.png["Grab GitHub Code"]

The Zip
~~~~~~~
Every Git repo has an option to download the entire project as a .zip file. Simply click on the ZIP button and your browser will download a copy of the project as a .zip file.

image::github/gh_zip.png["Zip Code"]

The Read-only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every Git repo has an option to download the a read-only copy of the project. You can use this option (via your Terminal app) to grab code if you're having firewall trouble.

Many firewalls will block the git:// and ssh URLs from working.

NOTE: you can read the following for more information, but it's a bit technical, link:https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use[Remote URLs]

The Clone
~~~~~~~~~
The last option we'll describe here is the clone button, which actually puts a copied version of a project on your computer without forking. This would allow you to contribute to the project, by pushing, or to update your own copy using a _rebase_ command from time to time.

image::github/gh_clone.png["Clone"]

Grab Gist Code
--------------
Grabbing code from Gist is pretty easy as well, there are 3 main options that we'll cover.

Every Gist repo has the following bar at the top of its page:

image::github/gist_getcode.png["Grab Gist Code"]

The Easiest
~~~~~~~~~~~
Most Gists that we'll be putting up online will only be a few lines of code.

_COPY AND PASTE_ the contents of the gist directly into your +C4WorkSpace.m+ file.

The Zip
~~~~~~~
For Gists that have more than one file, you can copy and paste if they're small enough, or you can click the *download* button and drag the files from the zip folder into your project.

The Clone
~~~~~~~~~
If you want, you can also clone the repo like a GitHub project and have a local copy on your computer. You do this by copying and pasting the clone address into your Terminal app.
